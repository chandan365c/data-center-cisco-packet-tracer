# Data Center in Cisco Packet Tracer

This is a simple simulation of a Data Center in Cisco Packet Tracer. <br>
The goal is to simulate a very basic idea of how different networks in different cities are connected to a common data center servers of any company/service. <br>
*NOTE: The real world implementation is much more complex than shown in the simulation*

### Components used:
- End devices (PCs)
- Switches
- Routers
- Servers *(Namely: HTTP, DNS and SMTP)*


The network consists of PCs as end devices which are connected to switches which are inturn connected to routers. <br>
The routers are connected to a common/main router which is then connected to the data center.
